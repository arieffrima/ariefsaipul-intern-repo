## Most Useful Shortcuts for My Work

The shortcuts I find most useful are `Ctrl + P` and `Ctrl + Shift + P`, as they allow me to quickly navigate files and execute commands without reaching for the mouse. Multiple cursors (`Alt + Click`) and `Ctrl + D` also save time when making bulk edits.

## How Keyboard Shortcuts Improve Productivity

Using shortcuts reduces the need to switch between the keyboard and mouse, allowing for a faster and more efficient workflow. Over time, muscle memory makes these actions second nature, increasing coding speed and reducing distractions.
