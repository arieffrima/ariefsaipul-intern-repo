# Reflection on BullMQ in NestJS

1. Why is BullMQ used instead of handling tasks directly in API requests?
- BullMQ is used to handle background tasks so that API requests are not blocked by long-running operations. This keeps the API responsive and ensures tasks like sending notifications or processing analytics don't slow down user interactions.

2. How does Redis help manage job queues in BullMQ?
- Redis stores job data and helps manage the state of jobs, like waiting, processing, and completed. It keeps jobs in order and ensures they are not lost, even if the app restarts. Redis also helps with retrying jobs and managing delays.

3. What happens if a job fails? How can failed jobs be retried?
- If a job fails, BullMQ retries it based on a set strategy, like how many times it should retry and the delay between retries. After reaching the maximum retry attempts, the job is marked as failed and can be reviewed for manual intervention.

4. How does Focus Bear use BullMQ for background tasks?
- Focus Bear uses BullMQ to process background tasks like sending notifications and syncing data. This allows the API to stay fast and responsive, while complex tasks are handled in the background.
