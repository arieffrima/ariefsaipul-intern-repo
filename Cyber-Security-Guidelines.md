# Cyber Security


## üîç Research & Learn

### 1. What Are Common Cyber Security Threats in a Remote Work Environment?
- Phishing attacks, Fraudulent emails or messages designed to trick you into providing sensitive information.
- Malware, Malicious software that can be introduced through email attachments, downloads, or compromised websites.
- Unsecured networks, Using public or shared Wi-Fi can expose devices to hackers.
- Lack of device security, Remote workers may neglect to update or secure personal devices, which can become entry points for cyber attacks.

### 2. What Are Best Practices for Keeping Your Devices and Accounts Secure?
- Keep software up to date, Regularly update your operating system, antivirus, and applications to patch vulnerabilities.
- Use strong passwords, Ensure passwords are unique, long, and complex.
- Enable firewalls and antivirus software, These act as the first line of defense against attacks.
- Encrypt sensitive data, Use encryption to protect information in case of device theft or loss.
- Backup data, Regular backups can help recover from attacks such as ransomware.

### 3. Why Is It Important to Lock Your Computer When Away From Your Desk?
Locking my computer when stepping away prevents unauthorized access. Physical security is as critical as digital security, and locking my screen helps protect sensitive data from prying eyes.

### 4. How Should You Handle Phishing Attempts and Suspicious Links?
- Do not click on suspicious links, Hover over links to see the actual URL before clicking.
- Verify the sender, If you receive an unexpected email asking for sensitive information, verify the sender before responding.
- Report phishing attempts, Report suspicious emails to your IT department or use phishing reporting tools.
- Do not open attachments from unknown sources, These may contain malware or viruses.

### 5. What Makes a Strong Password, and Why Should You Use a Password Manager?
- A strong password should be at least 12 characters long, include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Avoid using easily guessable information like names, birthdates, or common words.
- **Use a password manager securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of using weak or repeated passwords.

### 6. Why Is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Important, and When Should You Enable It?
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring two forms of identification‚Äîsomething you know (password) and something you have (a phone or authentication app).
- Enable 2FA on all accounts that support it, especially for email, cloud services, and financial platforms, to protect against unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.

## üìù Reflection

### 1. What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
- Currently, I follow best practices like using unique and complex passwords for most accounts and enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) where possible. 
- I could further enhance my security by using a password manager to store and generate complex passwords, and ensuring all devices are encrypted.

### 2. How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
- To make secure behavior a habit, I can integrate security measures into my daily workflow, such as always locking my computer when leaving my desk and regularly reviewing my password security.
- I will also set reminders to update my passwords and review the security settings for my accounts periodically.

### 3. What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
- I will use a password manager to store complex passwords and avoid reusing them across different accounts.
- I will enable 2FA on all accounts that support it, particularly for critical accounts like email, cloud storage, and financial platforms.
- I will regularly audit and update passwords for sensitive accounts.

### 4. What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
- If I suspect a breach, I would:
  1. Immediately change my password for the affected account.
  2. Enable 2FA if it wasn't already active.
  3. Review recent account activity to identify any unauthorized actions.
  4. Report the incident to the IT team or the relevant platform support to investigate further.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

### 1. Ensure your work accounts have strong passwords and enable 2FA where possible.
- I will verify that all my work accounts are secured with strong passwords and that 2FA is enabled wherever possible.

### 2. Review your password storage method‚Äîif you‚Äôre not using a password manager, consider setting one up.
- I will set up a **password manager** to securely store my passwords and generate strong, unique ones for each account.

### 3. Set up your computer and phone to automatically lock (require a password or biometric login) if you are away for more than a few minutes.
- I will adjust the settings on my computer and phone to automatically lock after a few minutes of inactivity, requiring a password or biometric login to unlock.

### 4. Document one new cyber security habit you will follow at Focus Bear.
- I will make it a habit to lock my computer whenever I step away, even for short periods, to ensure my work data is secure.
- I will logout every account in my laptop to ensure that everything save and look like new laptop.
