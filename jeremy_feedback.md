- I suggest including a calendar feature, especially when creating a to-do. It feels a bit confusing to set a structured time.
- On Windows, after creating a habit, I have to minimize the page to see the save button. It would be better if the button were placed a bit higher.

![Every time I edit or create a habit and click the save button, the app automatically restarts. Is this normal?](https://github.com/arieffrima/ariefsaipul-intern-repo/images/feedback_2.png)

- **My Daily Routine:**
  I usually wake up at 6:00 AM (I hope I won’t use my phone because Focus Bear will remind me of my routine and lock the apps/websites I’ve chosen, like Instagram, until I finish work at 3:30 PM, except during free time like breaks or lunch).
  I start using my laptop from 8:00 AM to 3:30 PM (Focus Bear keeps running, reminding me to stay on track and blocking distractions).
  Overall, Focus Bear is good for me—just needs a calendar feature in the future.

- I've updated all files in the `clean-code` folder.

![Doesn't seem like a great example. A more likely example is the same function in multiple files, which can then be abstracted to a module.](https://github.com/arieffrima/ariefsaipul-intern-repo/clean-code/clean_code_63.md)

![I don't think that comment is useful. It adds no more info than the code does. A better example would be explaining that sales tax is only calculated in Wyoming. Also, the code is not readable on GitHub due to Markdown issues.](https://github.com/arieffrima/ariefsaipul-intern-repo/clean-code/clean_code_65.md)

![When you refactored the long function into sub-functions, you left another code smell. The AuthService scares me—please read this article:](https://withblue.ink/2020/04/08/stop-writing-your-own-user-authentication-code.html)

![Good to see you tested it out. Why would Node 18 be slimmer than Node 20? Node 18 is EOL in April this year, so it's not a sensible approach.](https://github.com/arieffrima/my-nestjs-project/pull/2/files?diff=split&w=0)

- I've updated the file from `18-slim` to `20-slim`.
