#### Why is code formatting important?

Code formatting makes the code easier to read and work with, especially in a team. It keeps everything consistent, reduces confusion, and helps prevent errors. Using Prettier and ESLint ensures everyone follows the same style automatically.

#### What issues did the linter detect?

After running ESLint, I found a few issues:
- Some strings used double quotes, while others used single quotes.
- Missing trailing commas in objects and arrays.
- Use of `var` instead of `let` or `const`.
- Missing semicolons.
- Some `console.log()` statements left in the code.
- Use of `==` instead of `===`.

#### Did formatting the code make it easier to read?

Yes, definitely. The code looked cleaner and more organized after fixing the issues. Consistent indentation, spacing, and styling made it easier to follow, more professional and easier to maintain.
