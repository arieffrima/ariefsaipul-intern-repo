- **Developers**: Responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining the codebase. They focus on implementing features and fixing bugs.
- **QA (Quality Assurance)**: Ensures the quality of the product by testing the features, finding bugs, and verifying that the product meets the requirements.
- **Product Manager (PM)**: Defines the product vision, goals, and roadmap. The PM works closely with stakeholders and the team to prioritize features and guide development.
- **Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)**: Ensures the team follows Agile practices and ceremonies, removes obstacles, and manages the project timeline.
- **Other Supporting Roles**:
  - **Stakeholders**: Provide input on the product‚Äôs direction and feedback on features.
  - **UX Designers**: Focus on user experience, ensuring the product is intuitive and meets user needs.
  - **Customer Support**: Handles feedback from users and assists with troubleshooting and resolving issues.

### 2. How Do These Roles Collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?

- **Kanban**: The focus is on continuous flow. Roles collaborate more asynchronously, and the team works together to prioritize tasks and resolve bottlenecks.
  - Developers and QA work closely to maintain consistent quality and minimize delays.
  - The Product Manager continuously adjusts priorities based on customer feedback and business needs.

- **Scrum**: Scrum is time-boxed and organized around sprints. The roles work closely in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives.
  - Developers and QA collaborate directly during the sprint to ensure features are built and tested.
  - The Product Manager defines the backlog and works with the team to plan for upcoming sprints.

### 1. What Are the Key Roles in an Agile Team, and What Does Each Role Do?

- **Developers**: Responsible for building the product. They write code, implement features, and fix bugs. They ensure the product works according to the specifications and requirements.
  
- **QA (Quality Assurance)**: Focuses on testing the product to ensure it meets quality standards. They perform manual and automated tests, report issues, and verify that the product works as expected.

- **Product Manager (PM)**: Oversees the product vision and strategy. They define the product roadmap, prioritize features, and ensure that the team is aligned with the business goals.

- **Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)**: Facilitates the Agile process by organizing ceremonies, helping the team stay on track, removing blockers, and ensuring the team adheres to Agile principles.

- **Other Supporting Roles**:
  - **Stakeholders**: Provide input on the product‚Äôs direction and ensure it aligns with business needs.
  - **UX Designers**: Responsible for designing user interfaces and ensuring the product is user-friendly.
  - **Customer Support**: Provides feedback from users and helps address customer issues.

### 2. How Do These Roles Collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?

- **Kanban**: Roles collaborate on a continuous flow of tasks. Developers and QA work together as tasks are moved through the board. There is no predefined sprint structure, so collaboration tends to be more fluid and continuous.
  
- **Scrum**: Roles collaborate within the constraints of a sprint. The product manager or product owner sets priorities, and the team works together to deliver those tasks within the sprint. The Scrum Master (Agile PM) facilitates the team‚Äôs work and ensures the Agile process is followed.

## üìù Reflection

### 1. What Is Your Role, and How Does It Contribute to the Agile Process?
- As a backend developer (NestJS), my role involves designing and building the backend systems, APIs, and services. I ensure the server-side logic is efficient and scalable. I contribute to the Agile process by delivering high-quality features and providing regular updates on my progress.

### 2. How Do Your Responsibilities Overlap or Interact with Other Roles in the Team?
- My responsibilities overlap with frontend developers when integrating the backend with the frontend. I work closely with QA to ensure the backend is thoroughly tested and meets the functional requirements. I also collaborate with the product manager to ensure that the backend aligns with product features and business goals.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

### 1. Write a Short Description of How Your Role Fits Into the Agile Team.
- As a backend developer, I work on implementing the server-side functionality of the application, creating APIs, and ensuring the backend services are reliable and performant. I collaborate with other developers, QA, and product management to ensure that the product‚Äôs technical requirements are met and that features are delivered on time.

### 2. Identify One Other Role You Frequently Collaborate With and Describe How You Can Improve Teamwork With Them.
- I frequently collaborate with frontend developers to integrate the backend with the user interface. To improve teamwork, we can establish clear communication around API specifications and define endpoint behaviors early in the process, ensuring both teams are aligned and avoid misunderstandings during implementation.
