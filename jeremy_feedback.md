# Issue - Jeremy Feedback  [Overall Feedback](https://github.com/arieffrima/ariefsaipul-intern-repo/issues/78)


## Here's the updated: 
#### 1. Add screenshots pointing out the specific things I think should be changed:

  - I suggest including a calendar feature, especially when creating a to-do. It feels a bit confusing to set a structured time.
  - On Windows, after creating a habit, I have to minimize the page to see the save button. It would be better if the button were placed a bit higher.

#### 2. Every time I edit or create a habit and click the save button, the app automatically restart. Is this normal?:

  - **My Daily Routine:**
    I usually wake up at 6:00 AM (I hope I won’t use my phone because Focus Bear will remind me of my   routine and lock the apps/websites I’ve chosen, like Instagram, until I finish work at 3:30 PM, except during free time like breaks or lunch).
    I start using my laptop from 8:00 AM to 3:30 PM (Focus Bear keeps running, reminding me to stay on track and blocking distractions).
  Overall, Focus Bear is good for me just needs a calendar feature in the future.

#### 3. Screenshot showing that I have set up a password manager:

#### 5. Take a photo of my workstation to verify ergonomic setup:

#### 6. Re-do/uninstall React Chrome extensions:

#### 7. Format code using three backticks:

- I've updated all files in the `clean-code` folder.

#### 8. Doesn't seem like a great example. A more likely example is the same function in multiple files, which can then be abstracted to a module:

#### 9. I don't think that comment is useful. It adds no more info than the code does. A better example would be explaining that sales tax is only calculated in Wyoming. Also, the code is not readable on GitHub due to Markdown issues:

[Check this](https://github.com/arieffrima/ariefsaipul-intern-repo/clean-code/clean_code_65.md)

#### 10. When you refactored the long function into sub-functions, you left another code smell. The AuthService scares me—please read this article

#### 11. Provide screenshots showing that you have tried a competitor app:

#### 12. Good to see you tested it out. Why would Node 18 be slimmer than Node 20? Node 18 is EOL in April this year, so it's not a sensible approach

- I've updated the file from `18-slim` to `20-slim`.
