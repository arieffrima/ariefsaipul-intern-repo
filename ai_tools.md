## Which AI tools did you try?  
I tried GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to see how they could help with coding.  

## What worked well?  
- GitHub Copilot was awesome for suggesting code while I was typing. It made things faster, especially for repetitive tasks.  
- ChatGPT was really helpful when I got stuck on a bug. It explained what was wrong and suggested ways to fix it.  
- Both tools saved me time by giving quick answers instead of searching through documentation for hours.  

## What didn’t work well?  
- GitHub Copilot sometimes gave code that didn’t fully work or wasn’t the best solution, so I had to double-check everything.  
- ChatGPT gave good explanations, but sometimes the code didn’t work exactly as expected, so I had to tweak it myself.  
- Neither tool is perfect—they help a lot, but I still need to think critically and test everything.  

## When is AI most useful for coding?  
- When I need quick code snippets instead of writing everything from scratch.  
- When I’m debugging and need help figuring out what’s wrong.  
- When I need a concept explained in a simple way.  
- When I want to speed up repetitive coding tasks.
