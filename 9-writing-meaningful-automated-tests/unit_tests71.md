### Why is automated testing important in software development?

Automated testing is super important because it helps catch bugs early, so you don’t end up with issues later on. It saves a lot of time since you don’t have to manually check everything all the time, it lets you add new features or change things without worrying about breaking stuff that already works so you feel more confident about pushing your code.

### What did you find challenging when writing your first Jest test?

Honestly, the hardest part for me was getting the setup right. I wasn’t sure if I had everything configured properly at first. Then, figuring out how to write the test itself was a little tricky like what exactly to test and how to use assertions correctly. But once I ran my first test and saw it work, it clicked and got a lot easier after that!
