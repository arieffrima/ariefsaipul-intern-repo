# Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work

### Risks of Using a Laptop Without Additional Accessories:

- Poor posture that results in back and neck pain.
- Wrist strain and potential repetitive strain injuries.
- Increased eye strain due to prolonged screen time.
- Fatigue and reduced efficiency.

### Ergonomic Tools to Enhance Posture:

- **Laptop Stand:** Elevates the screen to maintain a natural neck position.
- **External Keyboard & Mouse:** Supports a neutral wrist posture.
- **Ergonomic Chair:** Provides proper lumbar support and comfort.
- **Monitor Stand or External Display:** Ensures the screen is at an optimal viewing height.
- **Footrest:** Aids in maintaining proper leg positioning.
- **Adjustable Desk:** Facilitates alternating between sitting and standing.

### Optimizing Desk Setup for Better Ergonomics:

- **Screen Height:** Position the monitor so the top aligns with or is slightly below eye level.
- **Seating Position:** Adjust the chair to ensure feet rest flat on the floor and knees are at a 90-degree angle.
- **Desk Arrangement:** Keep elbows at a 90-degree angle and wrists straight while typing.
- **Lighting:** Reduce screen glare with appropriate lighting.
- **Organized Workspace:** Place frequently used items within easy reach to avoid unnecessary strain.

### Daily Practices to Minimize the Effects of Long Laptop Use:

- **Regular Movement Breaks:** Stand up and stretch every 30‚Äì60 minutes.
- **Posture Awareness:** Keep the back straight and shoulders relaxed.
- **Reducing Eye Strain:** Follow the 20-20-20 rule (look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes).
- **Hydration & Nutrition:** Drink enough water to stay alert and reduce fatigue.
- **Breathing Exercises:** Incorporate deep breathing to relieve tension and stress.
