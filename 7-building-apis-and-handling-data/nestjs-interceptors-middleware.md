# Reflection (nestjs-interceptors-middleware.md)

- **What is the difference between an interceptor and middleware in NestJS?**
  - Middleware runs before the route handler. It's mainly used for things like logging, authentication, and modifying requests.
  - Interceptor runs after the route handler and can modify the response or handle things like logging, caching, or transforming data before sending the response back to the client.

- **When would you use an interceptor instead of middleware?**
  - I would use an interceptor when I want to manipulate the response after the route handler or if I need to do things like logging the response data or transforming data before sending it back to the client. 
  - I would use middleware when I need to process the request before the route handler, like handling authentication or logging request data.

- **How does LoggerErrorInterceptor help?**
  - The LoggerErrorInterceptor helps by catching errors in the application and logging them. This makes it easier to see what went wrong and helps me debug the app. Instead of errors just being thrown and not logged, the interceptor ensures that they get logged and I can track them.
