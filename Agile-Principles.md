# Module 1: Agile Principles & Frameworks

## üîç Research & Learn

### 1. What is Agile, and How Does It Differ from Traditional Project Management?
- Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to project management that focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It emphasizes delivering small, usable pieces of a project quickly, allowing teams to adapt to changes more easily.
- Traditional project management (Waterfall) follows a linear, sequential approach. It is typically rigid, with clearly defined stages that must be completed before moving on to the next. It often doesn‚Äôt accommodate changes once the project is underway.

### 2. What Are the Core Values and Principles of Agile? (Hint: Check the Agile Manifesto)
The Agile Manifesto outlines four core values:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

These values guide Agile teams to prioritize people, communication, and adaptability over rigid plans and documentation.

The 12 principles of Agile include:
- Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
- Deliver working software frequently.
- Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.
- Build projects around motivated individuals.
- Maintain a sustainable working pace.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.
- Simplicity‚Äîthe art of maximizing the amount of work not done.
- Self-organizing teams.
- Regular reflection on how to become more effective.

### 3. What Are the Differences Between Scrum and Kanban, and When Is Each Used?
- **Scrum**: A framework with fixed-length sprints (usually 2-4 weeks). Scrum has defined roles (e.g., Scrum Master, Product Owner) and ceremonies (e.g., Sprint Planning, Daily Standups). It is best used in teams that have clear and fixed priorities that can be completed in a sprint.
- **Kanban**: A flexible, continuous-flow system without fixed-length sprints. Tasks are represented on a board and moved through stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). Kanban is often used when the work is ongoing and requires constant prioritization, allowing for more fluid adaptation.

### 4. Why Does Focus Bear Lean Towards Kanban Instead of Scrum?
- Focus Bear likely leans towards Kanban due to its flexibility, especially in managing work items that vary in priority and scope. Kanban allows for continuous delivery and real-time task adjustments, making it well-suited for an environment that needs to respond quickly to changing requirements.

## üìù Reflection

### 1. What Do You Think Are the Biggest Benefits and Challenges of Agile?
- **Benefits**:
  - Flexibility, agile allows for adjustments at any point in the project based on feedback and changing needs.
  - Customer Collaboration, frequent feedback ensures that the product meets customer expectations.
  - Faster Delivery, Small, incremental deliveries allow faster deployment of functional software.

- **Challenges**:
  - Agile requires teams to be adaptable, which can be difficult for those used to rigid plans.
  - Because requirements can change frequently, managing scope creep can be a challenge.
  - Agile may lead to unpredictability in resource needs, making it difficult to plan long-term.

### 2. How Can Agile Principles Help Improve Your Role and Responsibilities?
- Flexibility and customer collaboration in Agile can help me as a backend developer to quickly adapt to changing technical requirements and customer feedback. Agile also emphasizes technical excellence, which motivates me to continuously improve the code quality and architecture of the backend services I develop.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

### 1. Summarize the Main Differences Between Scrum and Kanban in Your Own Words.
- Scrum is a structured framework with fixed sprints, defined roles, and ceremonies. It works best for teams with specific tasks that can be completed within a sprint. 
- Kanban is a flexible, continuous-flow system where tasks move through a workflow at their own pace. There are no fixed sprints or roles, and tasks can be adjusted as needed. Kanban is ideal for ongoing work that needs constant prioritization.

### 2. Identify One Agile Principle You Think Will Be Most Useful in Your Work.
- Customer collaboration is a principle that will be especially useful in my role as a backend developer. It ensures that I‚Äôm building the backend systems according to the actual needs of the user, rather than following an initial set of requirements without considering feedback.
