- **What are the benefits of using nestjs-pino for logging?**  
  Using nestjs-pino for logging helps in keeping track of events in a structured way, making it easier to debug and monitor the app. It also supports JSON formatting, which is useful for analyzing logs in production environments.

- **How does global exception handling improve API consistency?**  
  Global exception handling improves API consistency by ensuring that all errors are handled the same way across the app. It prevents random error formats and helps in providing more meaningful responses to users.

- **What is the difference between a logging interceptor and an exception filter?**  
  A logging interceptor is used to log specific information about incoming requests and outgoing responses, like request time, headers, or body. An exception filter, on the other hand, is used to catch and handle errors thrown in the application, and format them for proper API responses.

- **How can logs be structured to provide useful debugging information?**  
  Logs can be structured by including important information like request details, timestamps, error stack traces, user ID, and status codes. This helps in debugging and understanding what happened at any point in the app's flow.
