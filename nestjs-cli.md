### Reflection  

#### 1. How does the NestJS CLI help streamline development?  
   - Automates scaffolding of modules, controllers, services, and other components.  
   - Reduces manual setup, saving time and effort.  
   - Ensures correct file structure and automatic imports.  

#### 2. What is the purpose of `nest generate`?  
   - Quickly generates various NestJS components (modules, controllers, services, etc.).  
   - Reduces boilerplate code and maintains project structure.  
   - Ensures components are properly registered within their modules.  

#### 3. How does using the CLI ensure consistency across the codebase?  
   - Enforces NestJS best practices for project structure.  
   - Uses predefined templates to maintain uniformity.  
   - Automatically updates module files with generated components.  

#### 4. What types of files and templates does the CLI create by default?  
   - **Module (`.module.ts`)** → Declares controllers and providers.  
   - **Controller (`.controller.ts`)** → Handles HTTP requests.  
   - **Service (`.service.ts`)** → Business logic layer.  
   - **Provider (`.provider.ts`)** → Custom provider for dependency injection.  
   - **Middleware, Guard, Interceptor, DTOs** → Additional components as needed.
