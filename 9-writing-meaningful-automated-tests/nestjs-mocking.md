# Reflection: Mocking in Unit Tests

- **Why is mocking important in unit tests?**
  I think mocking is super important because it helps me isolate what I'm testing. Instead of worrying about real external things like databases or APIs, I can just simulate how they behave. This makes my tests faster, more reliable, and easier to control.

- **How do you mock a NestJS provider (e.g., a service in a controller test)?**
  To mock a NestJS provider, I usually use `jest.fn()` or NestJS testing utilities. In a controller test, I'll create mock functions for the provider methods and inject the mock provider into the testing module.

- **What are the benefits of mocking the database instead of using a real one?**
  Mocking the database is helpful because it means I don’t have to actually interact with a real database. This speeds up my tests, ensures I don’t mess with real data, and gives me more control over the data being used in tests.

- **How do you decide what to mock vs. what to test directly?**
  I usually mock anything that’s external or complex, like databases, APIs, or services I don't need to test right now. I focus on testing the actual logic of the unit I'm working on, like a service or controller, so my tests are more focused and quicker.
