## function that doesnâ€™t properly handle errors or invalid inputs:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from "@nestjs/common";

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  private users = [
    { id: 1, email: "user1@example.com" },
    { id: 2, email: "user2@example.com" },
  ];

  getUserById(id: number) {
    return this.users.find((user) => user.id === id);
  }
}
```

- No Input Validation: The function does not check whether id is valid before executing, which can lead to runtime errors.
- Returns undefined for Nonexistent Users: If no user is found with the given id, the function returns undefined, which could cause unexpected errors when used elsewhere.
- No Error Handling Mechanism: There is no structured way to handle errors, making debugging and maintenance difficult.

## Refaktoring:

```typescript
import {
  Injectable,
  NotFoundException,
  BadRequestException,
} from "@nestjs/common";

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  private users = [
    { id: 1, email: "user1@example.com" },
    { id: 2, email: "user2@example.com" },
  ];

  getUserById(id: number) {
    if (!id || isNaN(id)) {
      throw new BadRequestException("Invalid user ID");
    }

    const user = this.users.find((user) => user.id === id);
    if (!user) {
      throw new NotFoundException(`User with ID ${id} not found`);
    }

    return user;
  }
}
```

- Guard Clause: Checks if id is valid at the start of the function. If it's invalid, an error is thrown immediately, preventing unnecessary execution.
- Input Validation: If id is missing or not a number, a BadRequestException is thrown to indicate an invalid request.
- Better Error Handling: If a user with the specified id is not found, a NotFoundException is returned with a clear message.
- Easier Debugging: By providing explicit exceptions, errors become more traceable and easier to fix.

## What was the issue with the original code?

The original code had several issues:

1. Lack of Input Validation: The function did not check whether `id` was valid before executing, which could lead to runtime errors.
2. No Error Handling for Missing Users: If a user with the given `id` was not found, the function returned `undefined`, which could cause unexpected errors when used in other parts of the application.
3. No Clear Error Messages: Without proper error handling, debugging issues in production would be difficult.

## How does handling errors improve reliability?

By adding proper error handling:

1. The function fails fast: when given invalid input, preventing unnecessary execution.
2. Better user experience: The application can provide clear error messages instead of failing silently.
3. Prevents unexpected crashes: Returning meaningful exceptions instead of `undefined` makes the code more predictable.
4. Improved maintainability: Future developers can understand and debug issues more easily.
