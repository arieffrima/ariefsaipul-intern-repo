### Why does Focus Bear double encrypt sensitive data instead of relying on database encryption alone?

So, Focus Bear doubles encryption mainly for extra security. The idea is that even if the database is compromised, the data would still be unreadable without the second layer of encryption. It adds that extra layer of protection in case one security measure fails. It's like having a lock on both the door and the window!

### How does typeorm-encrypted integrate with TypeORM entities?

The `typeorm-encrypted` package lets me easily encrypt and decrypt sensitive data in TypeORM entities. It's pretty cool because I don't have to write custom code to handle encryption. I just use decorators in the entity class, and it takes care of the rest. I can store encrypted data in the database, and when I need it, it decrypts it automatically when I retrieve the data.

### What are the best practices for securely managing encryption keys?

For encryption keys, it's best to store them somewhere secure, like a dedicated key management service (KMS) or a hardware security module (HSM). I should avoid storing keys directly in the codebase or in the database itself. The idea is to keep them isolated from the data they're protecting. Regular key rotation is also a good practice to minimize the risk of keys being compromised over time.

### What are the trade-offs between encrypting at the database level vs. the application level?

Encrypting at the database level is easier because the database handles the encryption and decryption, and I don't need to worry about it in my code. But, the keys are usually stored within the database, which might make it more vulnerable. On the other hand, application-level encryption gives me more control over how data is encrypted, and I can use more advanced methods like double encryption, but it means I need to handle the encryption and decryption manually in my code, which can be error-prone.
