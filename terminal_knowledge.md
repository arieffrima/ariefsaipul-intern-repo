# Terminal Knowledge  

## Which terminal client did you choose? Why?  
I chose Windows Terminal with PowerShell because itâ€™s flexible, supports multiple shells (like Git Bash and WSL), and looks better than the default command prompt. It also works well with my development setup.  

## What customizations (if any) did you make?  
- Installed Oh My Posh to customize the prompt with a nice theme.    
- Enabled transparency and changed the font to make it look cleaner.  

## What was the most useful command you learned today?  
The `grep` command (or `Select-String` in PowerShell) is super useful for searching through files. I can use:  

```bash
grep "error" log.txt
