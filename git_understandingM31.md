# Understanding Git Bisect

## What is `git bisect`?

`git bisect` is a debugging tool that performs a binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug in a Git project.

## When to Use It?

`git bisect` is useful when a project has many commits, making it time-consuming to check each commit manually.

## Comparison with Manual Checking

- `git bisect`: Speeds up the process of identifying the problematic commit using a binary search algorithm.
- Manual checking: Requires reviewing each commit one by one, which is much slower.
