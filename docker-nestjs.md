# Docker and NestJS Reflection

### 1. How does a Dockerfile define a containerized NestJS application?

The Dockerfile defines a containerized NestJS application by specifying the base images, setting up the working directory, copying the application files, installing dependencies, and defining how the application should run. The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build process to first create a build environment (with Node.js dependencies) and then produce a smaller production image. In my case, I used `node:20-slim` as the base image to install dependencies and build the NestJS app, then switched to `node:18-slim` for a smaller production image. This reduces the final image size and improves performance when running the container in production. The app listens on port 3000, and the `CMD` instruction starts the application by running the built app with `node dist/main`.

### 2. What is the purpose of a multi-stage build in Docker?

The purpose of a multi-stage build in Docker is to optimize the Docker image by using multiple intermediate images in the build process. In my case, I used a multi-stage build to separate the build environment from the production environment. The first stage (`base`) installs the necessary dependencies and builds the NestJS application, while the second stage (`node:18-slim`) copies the built app and necessary dependencies into a smaller image. This reduces the overall size of the final image, which is important for efficient deployment and resource usage.

### 3. How does Docker Compose simplify running multiple services together?

Docker Compose simplifies running multiple services by using a single YAML configuration file (`docker-compose.yml`) to define and manage all the services needed for the application. In my setup, Docker Compose allows me to define both the NestJS and PostgreSQL services, including their configurations (like environment variables and ports). With a single command (`docker-compose up`), Docker Compose spins up all the containers, links them together, and ensures they run smoothly. It also helps with service dependencies, making sure the PostgreSQL container is ready before the NestJS application tries to connect to it.

### 4. How can you expose API logs and debug a running container?

To expose API logs and debug a running container, I can use the `docker logs` command to view the logs of a specific container. For example, to check the logs of the NestJS container, I can run:

```bash
docker logs <nestjs_container_id>
