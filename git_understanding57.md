# Understanding Commit Messages

## What Makes a Good Commit Message?

- Clear and concise description of the change.
- Uses imperative mood (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").
- Explains both "what" and "why" rather than just "how".

## How Does a Clear Commit Message Help in Team Collaboration?

- Makes it easier for teammates to understand changes.
- Helps in debugging by tracking when and why a change was made.
- Improves version control history readability.

## How Can Poor Commit Messages Cause Issues Later?

- Difficult to understand past changes.
- Harder to identify when and where a bug was introduced.
- Can lead to confusion in large teams working on the same codebase.
