# NestJS Debugging in VS Code - Reflection

## How do breakpoints help in debugging compared to console logs?

Breakpoints are more convenient than console logs because they let us pause the code at a specific point, check variable values directly, and step through execution without constantly editing and restarting the code.

## What is the purpose of launch.json, and how does it configure debugging?

`launch.json` is a configuration file in VS Code that sets up how the debugger connects to the application. It defines the debugging port, source maps, and how to handle restarts, making debugging easier without manual setup each time.

## How can you inspect request parameters and responses while debugging?

When a request comes in, we can pause at a breakpoint in the controller or service and check the request parameters in the Variables tab or by hovering over variables. We can also see the response before it is sent to the client.

## How can you debug background jobs that donâ€™t run in a typical request-response cycle?

For background jobs (like using BullMQ), we can set breakpoints in the job processor and manually trigger a job. If the job runs automatically, using console logs first helps confirm it's being executed before diving deeper into debugging.
