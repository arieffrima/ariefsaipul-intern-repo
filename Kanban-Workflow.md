# Agile Workflows & Kanban

## üîç Research & Learn

### 1. How Does a Kanban Board Work, and How Does It Help Manage Workflow?
- A Kanban board is a visual tool used to manage the flow of tasks or work items through various stages of a project. The board is divided into columns representing different stages of the workflow (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Done). 
- Tasks are represented by cards or sticky notes that move across the columns as they progress. It helps teams visualize the work, identify bottlenecks, and manage task flow efficiently.

### 2. What Do the Different Columns on a Kanban Board Represent?
- **Backlog**: Tasks that are planned but not yet started. These need to be prioritized before being worked on.
- **In Progress**: Tasks that are currently being worked on by team members.
- **Blocked**: Tasks that cannot proceed due to some issue or dependency.
- **Done**: Tasks that have been completed.

### 3. How Do Tasks Move Through the Board, and Who Is Responsible for Updating Them?
- Tasks move from left to right, starting from the **Backlog** to **In Progress**, and eventually to **Done**.
- The responsibility for updating the task status typically lies with the person actively working on it, but team members and project managers may update the board to reflect any changes in status.

### 4. What Are the Benefits of Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)?
- Limiting WIP ensures that team members focus on completing tasks before starting new ones, preventing task overload and improving quality.
- It helps highlight bottlenecks and areas where resources are needed, ensuring smoother flow and preventing the team from spreading itself too thin.

## üìù Reflection

### 1. How Does Kanban Help Manage Priorities and Avoid Overload?
- Kanban helps prioritize work by clearly visualizing what tasks are in the Backlog and their status in the In Progress stage. 
- It prevents overload by enforcing WIP limits, which ensures that no team member has too many tasks at once, making it easier to focus and complete tasks efficiently.

### 2. How Can You Improve Your Workflow Using Kanban Principles?
- I can improve my workflow by setting WIP limits for each stage, ensuring I don't take on too many tasks at once. 
- I will use the Kanban board to track progress visually, which will help me stay organized, prioritize tasks effectively, and identify any bottlenecks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

### 1. Check Out Focus Bear‚Äôs Kanban Board and Note How Tasks Are Structured.
- Tasks are structured and organized, how tasks are moved through the workflow and how priorities are tracked.

### 2. Move at Least One Task Through the Kanban Process and Update Its Status Correctly.
- I will choose one task and move it through the Kanban board, updating its status as it progresses (from Backlog to In Progress, and eventually to Done).

### 3. Identify One Way You Can Improve Task Tracking in Your Role.
- I will use WIP limits to avoid taking on too many tasks at once and focus on completing high-priority tasks first. This will help improve my task tracking and productivity.
