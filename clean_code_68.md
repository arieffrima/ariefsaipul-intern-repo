# Identifying & Fixing Code Smells

## âœ… Code Smells Found:

1. **Magic Numbers & Strings** â€“ Using hardcoded values instead of constants.
2. **Long Functions** â€“ Functions that handle too much and should be broken into smaller parts.
3. **Duplicate Code** â€“ Copy-pasting logic instead of reusing functions.
4. **Large Classes (God Objects)** â€“ Classes that take on too many responsibilities.
5. **Deeply Nested Conditionals** â€“ Complex if/else trees that make code harder to follow.
6. **Commented-Out Code** â€“ Unused code that clutters the codebase.
7. **Inconsistent Naming** â€“ Variable names that donâ€™t clearly describe their purpose.

## ðŸ”§ How Did Refactoring Improve Code Quality?

- Improved readability: The code is now cleaner and easier to understand.
- Easier debugging: A well-structured codebase makes it easier to spot errors.
- Reduced duplication: More reusable functions result in more efficient code.
- Better maintainability: A modular structure makes future development smoother.

## ðŸ›  How Does Avoiding Code Smells Help Debugging?

- Clearer code: Well-structured code is easier to understand and debug.
- Reduced complexity: Simplified logic reduces the chances of errors.
- Refactoring modularization: Each part of the code now has a clear responsibility.
