### When do I prefer using AI vs. searching Google?

I use AI when I need quick answers, code snippets, or debugging help. It's fast and helps me organize my thoughts. But for official docs, real-world examples, or more reliable sources, I search Google.

### When do I ask a colleague?

- If it's project-specific, like architecture or internal best practices

- If it's urgent and blocking my work

- If it's about sensitive data (security, internal APIs)

- If I've already tried AI and Google but still stuck

### Challenges when troubleshooting alone

- Too much info, not all of it useful

- AI sometimes gives wrong answers

- Some error messages are unclear

- Going in circles trying random fixes

- Takes longer than asking someone experienced
