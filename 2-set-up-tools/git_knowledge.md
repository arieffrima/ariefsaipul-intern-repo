# Git Knowledge

## Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?
Yes, I have used Git before for personal projects and coursework. I mainly use it for version control when developing web applications. I also use GitHub to collaborate with teammates.

## Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?
I use Git via the command line (CLI) because it provides more control and flexibility. However, I sometimes use GitHub Desktop for visualizing commits and branches.

## What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?
One interesting thing I learned is interactive rebase (`git rebase -i`), which allows you to modify commit history, squash commits, and keep the repository clean. It helps maintain a more readable commit history.
