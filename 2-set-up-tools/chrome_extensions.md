# Chrome Extensions for Web Development  

## Which extensions did you install? Why?  
I installed all:  

- React Developer Tools – Lets me inspect React components and see props, state, and component trees. Super useful for debugging React apps.  
- Redux DevTools – Helps track state changes in Redux, making it easier to debug and understand how data flows in my app.  
- JSON Viewer – Formats JSON responses from APIs, making them way easier to read instead of looking at a big messy block of text.  
- Lighthouse – Runs performance audits on web apps, checking things like speed, accessibility, and SEO. Helps optimize websites.  

## What was the most useful thing you learned?  
React Developer Tools makes it way easier to debug components compared to using just the console.
