### Key Differences Between Unit, Integration, and E2E Tests

- Unit Tests: Test small functions or methods alone. Fast, no external stuff.
- Integration Tests: Check if different parts of the app work together. Slower, might involve a database or API.
- E2E Tests: Simulate real user actions, testing the whole system. Slowest but most reliable.
