# Understanding Merge Conflicts in Git

## What Caused the Conflict?
The conflict occurred because the same lines in the same file were modified differently in the `main` and my `feature-branch` branches. Git couldn't automatically determine which changes to keep, requiring manual resolution.

## How Did You Resolve It?
The conflict was resolved by manually editing the conflicted file to merge the desired changes from both branches. This involved reviewing both sets of changes, deciding on the final content, and then committing the resolved file.

## What Did You Learn?
This exercise emphasized the importance of clear communication and coordination in collaborative projects to minimize conflicts. It also provided hands-on experience with GitHub Desktopâ€™s conflict resolution tools, highlighting the need for careful review during merges to ensure code integrity.
